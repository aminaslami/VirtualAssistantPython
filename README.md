# VirtualAssistantPython

### Python virtual assistant project using the speech_recognition and pyttsx3 libraries:


"In this example, the virtual assistant listens for user input through the microphone and converts it to text using the speech_recognition library. It then responds to various commands and performs tasks accordingly."

The listen() function captures the user's speech and converts it into text. The speak() function utilizes the pyttsx3 library to convert text into speech.

The virtual_assistant() function implements a basic conversation loop. It listens to the user's query, converts it to lowercase for easier comparison, and then responds accordingly. The assistant understands "hello" and "goodbye" greetings, tells the current time when asked, performs a Google search, and opens applications based on user input.

When you run the script, the virtual assistant will greet you and wait for your commands. You can interact with it by speaking commands or questions. It will respond to your queries using text-to-speech output.

Feel free to customize and enhance the code to add more functionality, integrate it with other APIs or services, or incorporate natural language processing (NLP) libraries like SpaCy or NLTK for advanced language understanding and processing.
